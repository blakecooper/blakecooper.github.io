<h2><b>2. Welcome to Economicon!</b></h2>
<p>While playing Economicon, you become the mightiest of all bureaucrats: the central banker. It is your sole responsibility to cultivate a strong, stable economy for your nation. Yet, despite the awesome power you wield, your challenges are many, and your tools are few.</p>
<p>A game of Economicon lasts ten rounds, each representing a year in the history of your nation. At the end of ten rounds, the winner of Economicon is the player commanding the most valuable, and least volatile, economy. The value of your economy is measured by holdings in your <a href="#" id = "popover_reserveBank" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" title="Reserve Bank" data-content="">reserve bank</a>. Volatility is measured by volatility tokens. You cannot win Economicon if you hold three or greater volatility tokens.</p>
<p>As a central banker, your most basic tool is choosing a currency peg that determines the value of your currency. Whether your currency is pegged to the value of gold, a commodity, another player's currency, or nothing at all, you peg determines how much your currency is worth, and, therefore, how much you pay for things. Each peg also comes with unique privileges and challenges.</p>
<p>Trading is the most powerful way central bankers increase the value of their reserve holdings. Bankers take turns purchasing gold, commodities or currency on the open market, paying an amount of gold or native currency based on the relative value of the units being purchased. Payments come from reserves, and go to the market. The amount of gold, currency and commodities available in the open market determine the value of these units, so strategically buying and selling them can dramatically impact the value of your (and the other bankers') economies.</p>
<p>Each round, your nation's people will work to produce commodities, so that they can earn money with which to consume other commodities. You must be able to keep your citizenry employed and consuming. If you fail to meet either your production or consumption requirement (or both) in a given round, you gain one volatility token.</p>
<p>And of course, central bankers like yourself have no control over the laws your nation's lawmakers regularly enact, often without regard to their impact on the economy. Furthermore, you'll have to contend with global events each round that require immediate action. Decide how (or whether) to cooperate with your fellow bankers in response. Just know that the results of your actions may greatly impact your economy--for better or worse!</p>
<h2>3. How to play</h2>
<h3>Before play begins</h3>
<p>Each player puts XXXX into reserves. XXXX is placed in the open market. Each player places a unit of gold on their peg counter, as each player begins the game on a gold standard.</p>
<p>Shuffle the global events and law cards.</p>
<h3>Rounds</h3>
<p>The game of Economicon takes place over ten rounds. During each round, in order:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>1. Gold is mined.</b> Each banker rolls a d6, and adds that amount of gold to their nation's reserves.</li>
  <li><b>2. A global event occurs.</b> One global event card is placed face up in the play area. It remains in effect until resolved (see phase 10, "Resolve the global event").</span></li>
  <li><b>3. Bankers may change their peg.</b> If a banker changes their nation's peg two rounds in a row, they gain a volatility token.</li>
  <li><b>5. Laws are ratified (turns 1, 3, 6 and 10).</b> Each banker draws a law card and places it face up in their play area. Unless otherwise directed, it remains in effect for the rest of the game.</li>
  <li><b>6. Goods are produced.</b> Each banker mandates a certain amount of each of the game's three commodities to be produced by their nation and sent to the market, paying all required production costs from reserves. Beyond satisfying production requirements to maintain employment, a banker may pay to produce any additional number of goods to be sent to the market. Set any goods produced aside until the next phase.</li>
  <li><b>7. Trade is conducted.</b> Starting with the player with the most gold in reserves and moving clockwise, bankers move the commodities their nation produced to the market. Bankers may also choose to send any commodities from their reserves into the market at this time. Then, bankers take turns purchasing commodities, currency or gold on the open market to keep in their reserves. A banker may purchase one type of unit per turn, and may purchase as much as they can afford. Bankers pay for market purchases from their reserves, using either gold or their native currency (if their currency is pegged to another currency, that currency counts as a native currency for that nation). To pay for a market purchase, determine the value of a unit in your native currency using the value formula, then place your payment in the market.</li>
  <li><b>8. Goods are consumed.</b> The people of your nation consume a number of each of the three commodities from your reserves equal to the number of laws currently in play for your nation.</li>
  <li><b>9. Rewards and penalties are distributed.</b> If during this round you complied with both your nation's production and consumption requirements, and its laws, you may add one gold to your reserves and remove one volatility token. Otherwise, gain a volatility token.</li>
  <li><b>10. Resolve the global event.</b> The outcome will be specific to the event, and determined by whether the bankers were successful or failed in meeting their goal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winning the game</h3>
<p>After ten rounds, everybody adds up the value of all holdings in their reserves. Unlike when making purchases, every banker uses gold as the payment unit in the numerator of the value function when determining their reserves' final value.</p>
<p>The player has the most valuable economy of all players without possessing greater than three volatility tokens is the winner.</p>

<h2>4. Definitions</h2>

<h3>Commodities</h3>

<p>There are three commodities in Economicon: grain, oil and tech. These represent goods that can be produced by your nation, sold on the open market, and consumed by your nation's people. 

<p>Commodities can be used as a currency peg. If you peg your currency to the value of a good, the amount of that good available in the market determines the value of your currency. As with any currency peg, any commodity you use as a peg counts as native currency.

<p>Nations have requirements for how many commodities must be produced for sale, and consumed by the public, each turn. Failure to meet these requirements will result in a volatility token for your nation.

<h3>Consumption Requirement</h3>

<p>Each round, the citizens of your nation will consume commodities from your central reserve bank. They will consume a number of each commodity equal to the number of laws in effect in your nation.

<p>If you do not hold enough of a commodity in reserves to satisfy your nation's consumption at any time, gain a volatility token.

<h3>Currency</h3>

<p>Currency is the symbolic unit nations use to make purchases. The value of a currency is determined by its peg, a referential unit that gives your symbolic currency meaning.

<p>All nations begin the game on a gold standard; each unit of currency is equal in value to one unit of gold. Once per turn, players may switch their currency to another peg. A peg can be gold, a commodity, or another player's currency.

<p>You can also remove the peg for your currency altogether. If you do this, the value of your currency is determined solely by how much of it is being traded in the market. While this can make the value of your currency unpredictable, it has one major benefit: you can choose at any time to create more of your currency by adding new units to the market, for free. 

<h3>Global Events</h3>

<p>Global event cards are drawn once at the beginning of each round, and stay in effect for the rest of the round. Global event cards describe conditions that take effect this round, a common goal for all players to meet, and consequences if the goal is or is not met by the final phase of the round. 

<h3>Gold</h3>

<p>Unlike commodities, gold is not produced at will by players, but instead mined. For this reason, gold is a more stable currency peg. Each nation begins the game with its currency pegged to the value of gold.

<p>Gold is a universal currency, meaning it may be used in place of every banker's native currency when making purchases on the market.

<p>The banker with the most gold held in reserves has special privilege in the order of play.

<p>Gold is the unit of value used by all bankers to determine the value of their reserves at the end of the game. 

<h3>Grain</h3>

<p>Grain is one of three commodities. 

<h3>Laws</h3>

<p>Law cards, under normal circumstances, are drawn once by players during rounds 1, 3 and 6 and remain in play for the remainder of the game. They describe conditions, representing laws passed in your country, to which you must adhere. If you fail to comply with one or more of your nation's laws in a given round, gain a volatility token.

<h3>Mining</h3>

<p>At the beginning of each round, every nation mines gold by rolling a d6, and placing that number of new units of gold into their reserves.

<h3>Native currency</h3>

<p>Each banker has a unit of currency that is unique to their nation. Bankers may use native currency from their reserves to pay for purchases on the open market.

<p>Your native currency may be pegged to gold, one of the three commodities, or another player's currency. If so, that unit counts as your native currency, and you may use it to pay for purchases as though it were your native currency.

<h3>New units</h3>

<p>New units are taken from out of game and placed in play, as opposed to taking a unit from reserves or the market.

<h3>Oil</h3>

<p>Oil is one of three commodities.

<h3>Order of play</h3>

When necessary to follow an order of play, the order of play is determined as follows:
1. The banker whose nation holds the highest amount of gold in reserves plays first, and play continues around the table clockwise from that banker.
2. In the event of a tie, all bankers who tie roll a d6. The higher of the rolls goes first, and play continues around the table clockwise from that banker.

<h3>Peg</h3>

<p>Currencies can be "pegged" to the value of gold, tradable commodities, or even other currencies, as a way to define, reinforce and stabilize their value. When you peg your nation's currency to a unit in Economicon, place a new counter for that unit on your peg token. One unit of your currency is now worth one of that unit.

<p>Currencies do not have to be pegged to anything, they can simply refer to their own value. If this is the case, you place a new unit of your own currency on your peg token. Until you change you peg, the value of your currency is equal to how much of it is available on the open market.

<p>Each position you take has potential advantages and disadvantages:
<br><b>- Pegging to gold</b> is the easiest way to maintain the stability of your currency's value, since gold cannot be produced by nations and must be mined through a predictable process. But pegging to gold offers you less flexibility, since you gain no benefit from using an additional commodity or currency as your native currency.
<br><b>- Pegging to commodities like wheat, oil or tech</b> allows you to spend that commodity in your reserves when buying on the open market, giving you a lot more buying power. But the value of commodities can be unpredictable, as your fellow bankers' nations can produce and purchase commodities at will, causing shortages or surpluses that dramatically affect supply and demand.
<br><b>- Pegging to another nation's currency</b> gives you the added security of tying your value to another banker with a vested interest in maintaining value and stability, effectively creating a de facto partnership, if not an official one. You also have the powerful benefit of trading directly with that nation. You and that nation's banker may buy and sell units from each other's reserves directly, without going through the market (although you must pay market value). However, this means you are also at the whim of that banker. If they devalue or inflate their nation's currency, either deliberately or by negligent fiscal policy, you will indirectly suffer the consequences.
<p><b>- Removing your currency peg altogether</b> is the only way to unlock one useful feature of the game: creating and destroying currency. With no relative value for your currency, you may at any time add new units of your currency to the marketplace, or remove them from the game. This gives you acute control over the value of your currency, but it can be its own downside, as you may unintentionally introduce inflation or deflation, crippling your economy in the process.

<p>If you change your peg in any round where you also changed your peg in the previous round, immediately gain a volatility token.

<h3>Production</h3>

<p>During the production phase of each round, players may produce commodities by paying an amount equal to 1/2 the relative market value of that commodity.

<p>Nations may produce commodities all at once, or follow the standard order of play, as agreed upon by the group. All nations set their commodities aside until the trading round before placing them in the market. Players may also choose to hide the number and type of commodities produced from other players until the trading phase.

<p>Production requirements state that each nation must produce at least one of all three commodities (grain, oil and tech) to maintain their nation's low unemployment rate. If they fail to do so, they gain a volatility token later in the round.

<h3>Production Requirement</h3>

Each round during the production phase, your population must be put to work producing at least one of each type of commodity. Discard an amount of gold equal to the value of that commodity for each commodity you produce. The commodities you produce are sent to the market, unless otherwise directed by a law or global event.

If at any time you cannot produce at least one of each commodity, gain a volatility token.

<h3>Reserve bank</h3>
<div id="reserveBank"></div>

<h3>Rewards and penalties</h3>

If during a given round you complied with both your nation's production and consumption requirements, and its laws, you may add one gold to your reserves and remove one volatility token. Otherwise, gain a volatility token.

<h3>Resolving the global event</h3>

The final action in a given round is to resolve the effects of the global event. The outcome will be specific to the event, and determined by whether the bankers were successful or failed in meeting their goal.

<h3>Tech</h3>

Tech is one of three commodities.

<h3>Trading</h3>

<p>Producing commodities for sale on the open market, and purchasing commodities, currency and gold on the open market, is the primary way value circulates in a game of Economicon.

<p>At the beginning of the trading phase, players begin by adding, in the standard order of play, any commodities they produced during the production phase to their assigned locations in the market, increasing the counter for each unit they add. They may also add any commodities held in reserves to the global market, at the same time and using the same process.

<p>After this step, bankers continue taking turns purchasing gold, commodities or currency from the market. Each turn, a player may purchase any available number of a single type of unit, provided that one unit of each commodity or currency remains in the market at all times. Gold, on the other hand, can be depleted by trading. If this happens, each player mines more immediately and sends it directly to the market.

<p>When determining how much to pay from reserves for your purchase, use the following formula:

<p>The number of payment units available in the market
<br>-------------
<br>the number of purchase units available in the market

<p>Payment units refer to the unit you're using to pay for the purchase, most often gold or your nation's currency. If your currency is pegged to another unit, count that unit in the marketplace instead of your currency when using the value formula. Purchase units refer to the units you are purchasing on the open market.

<p>If the amount you're purchasing requires you to spend a fraction of your currency, round to the nearest whole number (zero excluded; you must always pay at least one unit of currency for a purchase).

Trading continues until all players have passed.

<h3>Unit</h3>

A unit refers to one counter of any type of currency, commodity or gold. 

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>As in real life, the value of a gold, commodities and currency in Economicon is relative, based on supply and demand. The more scarce something is, the more you can expect to pay for it.

<p>Using a currency peg is a way to assign a value for your currency other than its inherent scarcity. When using a peg, your currency is exactly as valuable as the unit you have pegged it to.

<p>When determining how much a commodity costs in Economicon, use the following formula: 

<p>The number of payment units available in the market
<br>----------
<p>the number of purchase units available in the market

<p>Payment units refer to the unit you're using to pay for the purchase, most often gold or your nation's currency. If your currency is pegged to another unit, count that unit in the marketplace instead of your currency when using the value formula. Purchase units refer to the units you are purchasing on the open market.

<p>Rounding: If the amount you're purchasing requires you to spend a fraction of your currency, round to the nearest whole number (excluding zero; you must always pay at least one unit of currency for a purchase).

<p>Example: your nation is on the gold standard, and you want to buy five units of grain. There are five gold and 20 grain on the market, so the cost of grain in your currency is 5/20 = 1/4, so you may purchase four grain for one unit of your currency. Therefore your purchase of five grain would cost 1.25, which you would round down to 1. 

<h3>Volatility token</h3>

There are three situations in which you may earn a volatility token:
1. If your nation fails to meet the production or consumption requirement
2. If you fail to comply with your nations laws
3. Based on your response to global events

You can remove one volatility token per round during your upkeep phase if you comply with all requirements and laws. Certain global events can also result in the removal of volatility tokens.
