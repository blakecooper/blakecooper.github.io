<h1><b>Economicon</b></h1>
<p>A game of macroeconomics
<br>Rules Document v. 0.1
<br>Updated 2019-10-24</p>
				</div>
<h2>Welcome to Economicon!</h2>
<p>When playing Economicon, you assume the role of the mightiest of all bureaucrats: the central banker. The responsibility is yours, and yours alone, to ensure that your nation's economy is strong and stable. Yet, despite the awesome power you wield, your challenges are many, and your tools are few.</p>
<p>A game of Economicon lasts ten <a href="#" id="popover_rounds" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" title="Round" data-content="">rounds</a>. Each round, you'll strategically set your nation's <a href=#" id="popover_currencyPeg" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" title="Currency Peg" data-content="">monetary policy</a>, encourage <a href="#" id="popover_production" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" title="Production" data-content="">production</a> of goods from various sectors of your economy, then arrange to <a href="#" id="popover_trading" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" title="Trading" data-content"">sell those goods on the global market</a>, all while contending with meddling lawmakers whose <a href="#" id="popover_laws" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" title="Laws" data-content="">laws</a> may or may not help you achieve your goals. You'll also have to decide how (or whether) to work with bankers from other nations to respond to chaotic <a href=#" id="popover_globalEvents" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" title="Global Events" data-content="">global events</a>, the outcomes of which could usher in a new era of prosperity for your nation... or ruin it!
<p>At the end of ten rounds, the winner of Economicon is the player who has amassed the most valuable assets in their nation's <a href="#" id = "popover_reserveBank" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" title="Reserve Bank" data-content="">reserve bank</a>... provided their economy isn't too volatile! You may receive <a href="#" id="popover_volatilityTokens" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" title="Volatility Tokens" data-content="">volatility tokens</a> if your nation's citizens are unemployed, resources become scarce, or you break the law. No player can win the game with three or greater volatility tokens.</p>
<p>The stakes are high, and every decision counts. Welcome to Economicon.

<h2>How to play</h2>
<h4>Before play begins</h4>
<p>Each player puts XXXX into reserves. XXXX is placed in the open market. Each player places a unit of gold on their peg counter, as each player begins the game on a gold standard.</p>
<p>Shuffle the global events and law cards.</p>
<h4>Rounds</h4>
<div id="rounds"></div>
<h4>Winning the game</h4>
<p>After ten rounds, everybody adds up the value of all holdings in their reserves. Unlike when making purchases, every banker uses gold as the payment unit in the numerator of the value function when determining their reserves' final value.</p>
<p>The player has the most valuable economy of all players without possessing greater than three volatility tokens is the winner.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h4>Commodities</h4>

<p>There are three commodities in Economicon: grain, oil and tech. These represent goods that can be produced by your nation, sold on the open market, and consumed by your nation's people. 

<p>Commodities can be used as a currency peg. If you peg your currency to the value of a good, the amount of that good available in the market determines the value of your currency. As with any currency peg, any commodity you use as a peg counts as native currency.

<p>Nations have requirements for how many commodities must be produced for sale, and consumed by the public, each turn. Failure to meet these requirements will result in a volatility token for your nation.

<h4>Consumption Requirement</h4>

<p>Each round, the citizens of your nation will consume commodities from your central reserve bank. They will consume a number of each commodity equal to the number of laws in effect in your nation.

<p>If you do not hold enough of a commodity in reserves to satisfy your nation's consumption at any time, gain a volatility token.

<h4>Currency</h4>

<p>Currency is the symbolic unit nations use to make purchases. The value of a currency is determined by its peg, a referential unit that gives your symbolic currency meaning.

<p>All nations begin the game on a gold standard; each unit of currency is equal in value to one unit of gold. Once per turn, players may switch their currency to another peg. A peg can be gold, a commodity, or another player's currency.

<p>You can also remove the peg for your currency altogether. If you do this, the value of your currency is determined solely by how much of it is being traded in the market. While this can make the value of your currency unpredictable, it has one major benefit: you can choose at any time to create more of your currency by adding new units to the market, for free. 


<h4>Currency Peg</h4>
<div id="currencyPeg"></div>

<h4>Global Events</h4>
<div id="globalEvents"></div>

<h4>Gold</h4>

<p>Unlike commodities, gold is not produced at will by players, but instead mined. For this reason, gold is a more stable currency peg. Each nation begins the game with its currency pegged to the value of gold.

<p>Gold is a universal currency, meaning it may be used in place of every banker's native currency when making purchases on the market.

<p>The banker with the most gold held in reserves has special privilege in the order of play.

<p>Gold is the unit of value used by all bankers to determine the value of their reserves at the end of the game. 

<h4>Grain</h4>

<p>Grain is one of three commodities. 

<h4>Laws</h4>
<div id="laws"></div>

<h4>Mining</h4>

<p>At the beginning of each round, every nation mines gold by rolling a d6, and placing that number of new units of gold into their reserves.

<h4>Native currency</h4>

<p>Each banker has a unit of currency that is unique to their nation. Bankers may use native currency from their reserves to pay for purchases on the open market.

<p>Your native currency may be pegged to gold, one of the three commodities, or another player's currency. If so, that unit counts as your native currency, and you may use it to pay for purchases as though it were your native currency.

<h4>New units</h4>

<p>New units are taken from out of game and placed in play, as opposed to taking a unit from reserves or the market.

<h4>Oil</h4>

<p>Oil is one of three commodities.

<h4>Order of play</h4>

When necessary to follow an order of play, the order of play is determined as follows:
1. The banker whose nation holds the highest amount of gold in reserves plays first, and play continues around the table clockwise from that banker.
2. In the event of a tie, all bankers who tie roll a d6. The higher of the rolls goes first, and play continues around the table clockwise from that banker.

<h4>Production</h4>
<div id="production"></div>

<h4>Production Requirement</h4>

Each round during the production phase, your population must be put to work producing at least one of each type of commodity. Discard an amount of gold equal to the value of that commodity for each commodity you produce. The commodities you produce are sent to the market, unless otherwise directed by a law or global event.

If at any time you cannot produce at least one of each commodity, gain a volatility token.

<h4>Reserve bank</h4>
<div id="reserveBank"></div>

<h4>Rewards and penalties</h4>

If during a given round you complied with both your nation's production and consumption requirements, and its laws, you may add one gold to your reserves and remove one volatility token. Otherwise, gain a volatility token.

<h4>Resolving the global event</h4>

The final action in a given round is to resolve the effects of the global event. The outcome will be specific to the event, and determined by whether the bankers were successful or failed in meeting their goal.

<h4>Tech</h4>

Tech is one of three commodities.

<h4>Trading</h4>
<div id="trading"></div>

<h4>Unit</h4>

A unit refers to one counter of any type of currency, commodity or gold. 

<h4>Value</h4>

<p>As in real life, the value of a gold, commodities and currency in Economicon is relative, based on supply and demand. The more scarce something is, the more you can expect to pay for it.

<p>Using a currency peg is a way to assign a value for your currency other than its inherent scarcity. When using a peg, your currency is exactly as valuable as the unit you have pegged it to.

<p>When determining how much a commodity costs in Economicon, use the following formula: 

<p>The number of payment units available in the market
<br>----------
<p>the number of purchase units available in the market

<p>Payment units refer to the unit you're using to pay for the purchase, most often gold or your nation's currency. If your currency is pegged to another unit, count that unit in the marketplace instead of your currency when using the value formula. Purchase units refer to the units you are purchasing on the open market.

<p>Rounding: If the amount you're purchasing requires you to spend a fraction of your currency, round to the nearest whole number (excluding zero; you must always pay at least one unit of currency for a purchase).

<p>Example: your nation is on the gold standard, and you want to buy five units of grain. There are five gold and 20 grain on the market, so the cost of grain in your currency is 5/20 = 1/4, so you may purchase four grain for one unit of your currency. Therefore your purchase of five grain would cost 1.25, which you would round down to 1.
